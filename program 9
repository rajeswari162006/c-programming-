9. Write a C program to calculate total price after discount.

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    float price, discountPercent, discountAmount, totalPrice;

    printf("Enter original price: ");
    scanf("%f", &price);

    printf("Enter discount percentage: ");
    scanf("%f", &discountPercent);

    discountAmount = (price * discountPercent) / 100;
    totalPrice = price - discountAmount;

    printf("Total Price after Discount = %.2f\n", totalPrice);

    return 0;
}
output:
Enter original price: 1000
Enter discount percentage: 10
Total Price after Discount = 900.00
