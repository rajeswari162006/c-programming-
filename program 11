11. Write a C program to check whether a person is eligible to vote.

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int age;

    printf("Enter your age: ");
    scanf("%d", &age);

    if(age >= 18) {
        printf("You are eligible to vote.\n");
    } else {
        printf("You are not eligible to vote.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
output:
Enter your age: 20
You are eligible to vote.

Enter your age: 16
You are not eligible to vote.
