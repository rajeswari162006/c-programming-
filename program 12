12. Write a C program to check pass or fail based on marks.

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    float marks;

    printf("Enter your marks: ");
    scanf("%f", &marks);

    if(marks >= 40) {
        printf("Congratulations! You have passed.\n");
    } else {
        printf("Sorry! You have failed.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}

output:
Enter your marks: 55
Congratulations! You have passed.

Enter your marks: 35
Sorry! You have failed.
