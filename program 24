24. Write a C program to count number of days worked in a month.
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int days, i, worked = 0;
    int status;

    printf("Enter number of days in the month: ");
    scanf("%d", &days);

    printf("Enter 1 if worked, 0 if not worked for each day:\n");

    for(i = 1; i <= days; i++) {
        printf("Day %d: ", i);
        scanf("%d", &status);

        if(status == 1) {
            worked++;
        }
    }

    printf("\nTotal number of days worked in the month = %d\n", worked);

    return 0;
}
output:
Enter number of days in the month: 5
Enter 1 if worked, 0 if not worked for each day:
Day 1: 1
Day 2: 1
Day 3: 0
Day 4: 1
Day 5: 0

Total number of days worked in the month = 3
